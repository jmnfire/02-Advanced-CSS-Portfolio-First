# 02-Advanced-CSS-Portfolio-First

## Description 
I see this as an ever evolving project.  
I wanted to make a profile page to showcase my projects and creativity. My motivation is to be different and more creative than the next student. Standing out.  
During this project I used different elements by looking up new ways to create them.  Debugging often and starting over if needed.  
I learned a lot durning this project and hope to continue evolving the page as I learn more throughout my time in this boot-camp course. In doing this profile page, I realized home much you can do using different tools on the web; there are so many was to be creative.
